Project Description:

Project Idea:

One of the major factors in the design, refurbishment and long-term maintenance of any golf course is the way the greens and fairways are watered. In some golf courses watering systems such as sprinklers or drip water wires are fitted to sprinkle the water automatically and reduce human load. Normally sprinkler systems operate with respect to time, which means if we program it on 9 am it will be on even if rain occurs during that particular time. Since water is a precious resource we need to use it very carefully. The Internet of things will make the system more efficient.
